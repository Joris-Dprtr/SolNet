# SolNet
Open-source tool to get a pre-trained deep learning model for solar forecasting purposes.

## Done

Base model:
1. User provides latitude and longitude
2. Source model gets returned

Updates:
1. Allow for GPU use

## Pipeline

### Short term
1. Make model based on diverse locations
   - How do we chose locations?
   - Allow user to specify how many locations? 
   - Decrease date range with increased locations? Logarithmic increase in data with more locations? 
     Or allow user to specify date range?
2. Allow user to specify features

### Long term
1. Finetuning functions
2. Additional models
3. GUI
